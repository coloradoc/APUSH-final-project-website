                    <p>At first, New Jersey was under Dutch control as a part of New Amsterdam. Then in 1664, the English captured the Dutch settlement of New Amsterdam, renaming it New York, and also gained control of the land that would become New Jersey. The Duke of York then granted the land between the Hudson and Delaware Rivers to two noblemen, Lord John Berkeley and Sir George Carteret, who established the colony of New Jersey. The colony attracted settlers from various backgrounds and developed a economy based on farming and trading. Interestingly, New Jersey was divided into East Jersey and West Jersey in 1674, each having its own government. However, the colony would eventually reunite as a single royal colony in 1702.</p>

                        In 1633, English settlers from the Massachusetts Bay Colony started settling southward in areas that would become Connecticut. They later drafted a document known as "the Fundamental Orders," often considered the first written constitution in North America. This document established a democratic government for Connecticut. The colony attracted Puritan settlers seeking religious freedom and a more democratic society.</p>

In 1647, Rhode Island passed the first law in the American colonies guaranteeing religious freedom.</p>
