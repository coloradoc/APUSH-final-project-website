    <h3>World War I</h3>

    <div class = "textInsideInfo">
        <p>
            World War I, also known as the Great War, was a global conflict that took place from 1914 to 1918, primarily between the Allies (United Kingdom, France, and Russia) and the Central Powers (Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire). The war introduced trench warfare and the introduction of new military technologies, leading to mass destruction and loss of life.
            
            The United States initially remained neutral under President Woodrow Wilson, following American tradition to stay out of European affairs. However, due to unrestricted submarine warfare by Germany, and the Zimmerman Telegram incident (which revealed a proposed alliance between Germany and Mexico against the US), public sentiment shifted. In April 1917, the US officially entered the war on the side of the Allies. More than two million American soldiers, served on the battlefields of Western Europe, making a decisive contribution to the defeat of Germany. The war ended with the signing of the Treaty of Versailles in 1919.</p>

      <div class="hidden">
        <ul style="padding-left: 25px;">
          <li><b>Unrestricted Submarine Warfare: </b> Germany, in an attempt to starve Britain into submission, had declared unrestricted submarine warfare, meaning that their submarines (U-boats) would sink any ship without warning in the waters around Britain. The sinking of non-military ships, especially the Lusitania in 1915, which resulted in the death of 128 American citizens, caused public outrage in the US and shifted public opinion against Germany.</li>
            <br>
          <li><b>Zimmermann Telegram: </b>In 1917, British intelligence intercepted a secret diplomatic communication issued from the German Foreign Office, known as the Zimmermann Telegram. The telegram proposed a military alliance between Germany and Mexico, promising to help Mexico recover territories it had previously lost to the US (Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona) if the United States entered the war. When this was made public, it stirred up a nationalistic fervor, rallying Americans towards war.</li>
            <br>
          <li><b>Economic Interests: </b> The United States had strong economic ties with the Allied powers, particularly Britain and France. By 1917, these nations were deeply indebted to the US due to the massive loans they had taken to finance their war efforts. A victory for the Central Powers could jeopardize the repayment of these debts. Therefore, it was in America's economic interest to ensure the success of the Allies.</li>

          <li><b>Declaration of War: </b>After maintaining neutrality for three years, the United States officially entered World War I on April 6, 1917, declaring war on Germany.</li>
          <br>

          <div class="image-container">
          <li><b>American Expeditionary Forces: </b>More than two million American soldiers, commonly referred to as "doughboys", were sent to fight in the war as part of the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF). The AEF, commanded by General John J. Pershing, played a significant role in the final offensives that led to the end of the war. Over 350,000 African Americans would serve, however they were subjected to discrimination and segregation. The most famous African American unit was the 369th Infantry Regiment, known as the "Harlem Hellfighters," which served on the front lines for 191 days, longer than any other American unit in the war. </li>

          <br>
          <li><b>Economic Support: </b> Prior to and during the U.S.'s military involvement, the United States provided significant economic support to the Allies. American industry supplied materials, ammunition, and other necessary supplies, and the U.S. government loaned billions of dollars to the Allies, significantly bolstering their war effort. One example of this can be seen with the Provision of Supplies and Arms. American factories produced vast amounts of war materiel, including arms, ammunition, uniforms, vehicles, and food supplies, which were shipped to the Allies. The United States would also give Loans and Credits (over $2 billion) to help support France and the United Kingdom in their war efforts. This was done to remain neutral to the European conflict, while still giving help to the Allies.</li>

        <ul style="padding-left: 25px;">
          <li><b>Armistice and Treaty of Versailles: </b>
            The war officially ended on November 11, 1918, when an armistice was signed. Later, the Treaty of Versailles was signed on June 28, 1919, officially ending the state of war between Germany and the Allies. U.S. President Woodrow Wilson played a key role in the negotiations and championed his Fourteen Points plan for the post-war order. However, many of his points were not included in the final treaty.</li>
          <br>
          <li><b>Senate Rejection of the Treaty of Versailles: </b>Despite Wilson's significant role in the crafting of the Treaty of Versailles, it faced opposition within the United States, particularly among isolationists in the Senate who believed it would entangle the U.S. in future European conflicts. The U.S. Senate ultimately did not ratify the Treaty, and the United States instead signed separate peace treaties with Germany, Austria, and Hungary.</li>
          <br>
          <li><b>Post-War Economic Boom: </b>The immediate aftermath of the war saw the U.S. economy experiencing a significant boom. Having emerged from the war largely unscathed and with its economy intact, the U.S. was able to quickly transition from a wartime to a peacetime economy. This led to the "Roaring Twenties," a decade of significant economic growth and cultural development in the United States.</li>
