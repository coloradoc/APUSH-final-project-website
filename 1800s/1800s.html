      </div>
      <p>
        The beginning of the 1800s was started with the Louisiana Purchase in 1803. The Louisiana Purchase was when America purchased the land of the Louisiana Territory from the French First Republic in 1803. The Purchase secured American access to the Mississippi River and its trade routes and doubled the size of the young United States, greatly shaping its future as a continental power. The Louisiana Purchase would also allow for westward expansion, exploration, and settlement.

        Shortly after the Louisiana Purchase, President Jefferson commissioned the Lewis and Clark Expedition on May 14, 1804 to explore and map the newly acquired territory, strengthening the U.S.'s claim to the western lands. The Lewis and Clark Expedition also mapped uncharted land, rivers, and mountains along with documenting western plants, animals, and Native American Tribes.

        Similarly to the Lewis and Clark Expedition, American General Zebulon Pike led an exploration of the southwestern portion of the Louisiana Purchase. The Lewis and Clark Expedition helped create understanding of the region's geography, including the discovery of what is now known as Pikes Peak located in Colorado.

        From 1812-1815, the United States was engaged in a war with Great Britain called the War of 1812. The war was caused by British interference with American trade, impressment of American sailors by British ships, and territorial disputes. The war resulted in a stalemate with no major territorial changes and a peace treaty called the Treaty of Ghent. This treaty ended the war of 1812. Despite the lack of clear winner, the War of 1812 would create American national identity, increase the national pride, and create a sense of unity, while also solidifying the United States' status as an independent nation on the international stage.

      <p>
        The Monroe Doctrine, introduced in 1823 by President James Monroe, was an impactful policy statement that proclaimed U.S. opposition to European interference in the Americas, marking a major step in establishing the country's stance in international affairs.The doctrine asserted that the United States would not interfere in the internal affairs of European nations. In turn, it expected European powers to refrain from interfering in the affairs of newly independent countries in the Western Hemisphere. The Monroe Doctrine was largely successful and established the U.S. as the dominant western power.

      <p>
        The 1830s saw the enactment of the Indian Removal Act under President Andrew Jackson, resulting in the removal of thousands of Native Americans from their lands, primarily from the Cherokee, Creek, Choctaw, Chickasaw, and Seminole tribes, in what became known as the Trail of Tears. The federal government believed that by removing Native American tribes and relocating them to remote territories, they could mitigate conflicts and make way for the settlement of white Americans.

        The Oregon Trail was a historic overland migration route used by pioneers and settlers to travel from the eastern United States to the Oregon Territory in the Pacific Northwest. It epitomizes the period of Manifest Destiny, a belief in the divine sanction for American expansion and a lure of fertile lands, economic opportunities, and the promise of a better life. Pioneers traveled in wagons, typically composed of family groups or individuals. They faced grueling conditions, enduring months of travel, with limited supplies and basic makeshift accommodations.

      <p>
        The Mexican American War would result in the United States gained a large ammount of territory in the West, including California and New Mexico. The war was caused by territorial disputes between the United States and Mexico. The borders of Texas were claimed by Mexico, but Texas had declared independence in 1836 and joined the United States in 1845, this created a large ammount of conflict. The United States would also claim that the border to Mexico was the Rio Grande, while Mexico instead insisted it was the Nueces River. The United States wanted to expand its territorial holdings further west, including California and New Mexico so the United States would eventually push for a war to fight for the territorial holdings. The war would end with an American victory and the war's conclusion with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, increasing Americas land.

        The discovery of gold in California in 1848 led to the Gold Rush, attracting hundreds of thousands of prospectors to the West and rapidly increasing the westward migration and expansion. The Gold Rush effected migration patterns to a great extent and the settlement of the American West. The rapid influx of prospectors accelerated the westward expansion of the United States, as people from various backgrounds and regions sought their fortunes in the gold fields.
